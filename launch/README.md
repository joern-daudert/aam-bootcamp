### Story

After setting up our website, we now want to make sure to capture behavioral event data (browsing habits, actionable triggers, etc). For this exercise, we will step into the shoes of the owners of La Boutique, a fashion retail website, and see how we can bring in behavioral and profile data from website interactions into AAM.

Let's create a Destination. Click the "Audience Data" button in the upper bar and choose "Segments" from the dropdown menu.

First we start with your Cookie Destination. Just select the segments that you have just created before and select them.

Next step is to fill out the "**Destination Value**" that will be visible within your Cookie. Just type in the name of the segments without spaces or "umlauts (ä,ö,ü etc.)". If we want to use them we would need to enable Serialize within the Cookie setup. The Start date should be today.

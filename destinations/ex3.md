Next step is to fill out the "**Destination Value**" that will be visible within your Cookie. Just type in the name of the segments without spaces or "umlauts (ä,ö,ü etc.)". If we want to use them we would need to enable Serialize within the Cookie setup. The start date should be today.

Now we need to fill in the destination URL. This will be  typically an URL hat contains a pixel. As an example we will use my RLSA List:


URL: http://www.google.de/pagead/1p-conversion/2594866157?ocid=105207893&userListId=736042993&__c=2594866157

Secure URL: https://www.google.de/pagead/1p-conversion/2594866157?ocid=105207893&userListId=736042993&__c=2594866157

### Story:

We have already learned how we build some traits and segments. Now it is time to activate them. We will build destinations step by step and activate your segments against your new destinations.

### What are destinations?

In Audience Manager, a destination is any third-party system (ad server, DSP, ad network, etc.) that you want to share data with. We want to use the Destination Builder, used to create and manage cookie, URL, or server-to-server destinations.

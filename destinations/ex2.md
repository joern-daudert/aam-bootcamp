From all the Experience Cloud solutions choose Audience Manager. You will be redirected to AAM.

Now we want to build a URL destination. Typical usecases could be Google Remarketing Lists (RLSAs) or Facebook Custom Audiences. For this we select the following settings:

![Destionations](./images/url_setup.png)

| Name              | Description | Category  | Type |	Auto-fill	|
| ----------------- | ----------- | --------- | ---- |  --------    |
| aam_bootcamp_YOURLASTNAME_url | This is my URL destination | Custom | URL |	|

Hit "**next**".

We don't need to check one of the Export Labels so skip this step by clicking on "**Configuration**"

Just click on "**save**"

That's it. Easy isn't it?
